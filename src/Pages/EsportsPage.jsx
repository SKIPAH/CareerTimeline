          During 2019-2022 I was a competitive esports athlete representing
          multiple Finnish and European teams and organizations in Overwatch and
          Valorant.

          My love for gaming started when I played Donkey Kong Country on Super
          Nintendo as a little kid. I have 4 brothers and I've usually been the
          one doing the hard parts of levels if my brothers couldn't. My friend
          groups in elementary school basically formed around other kids that
          liked games like Runescape and all the DragonBall Z games. Once I
          moved to another city for 7th grade, I ended up finding group of
          friends that played Call Of Duty 4 on pc, where I got my first
          introduction to esports side of gaming, that wasn't really a thing
          back then yet during 2010-2012.

          During high school when I stopped competing in track and field and
          wrestling, I put crazy hours in Dota 2 which grew rapidly as a esports
          title. I got my first real experiences what playing in a team
          environment competitively meant. After high school I was doing the
          mandatory finnish military service and while I had few months left, I
          found out about Overwatch videogame that going to be released just
          after my service ends. I said to my military friends that I'm going to
          become a professional Overwatch player and started instantly grinding
          hard.

          During the first season of ranked I managed to get my peak rank to
          top500, but ended up falling outside once the season ended. I realized
          that I might have the potential, because I got contacted often to join
          different teams. After the first season I worked as security guard and
          my shifts were mostly during the nights, which made me unable to even
          play for any teams and long working hours made my practicing even
          harder. I still slightly regret that I didn't pursue Overwatch fully
          during that time, as I might have ended up gaining different
          opportunities in the scene but it is what it is. Once I quit my
          security guard job and started studying in Oulu University of Applied
          Sciences, I could put more time into Overwatch.

          I played in some finnish teams here and there and competed in few
          small online tournaments. One day I noticed a post about a finnish
          organization called "Nyyrikki Esports" searching for players to
          represent them in Overwatch. This of course sparked my interest as it
          might be my chance to start my professional career what I've planned
          to do.
