            Hi. My name is Jussi Mehtälä, also known as SKIPAH in the gaming
            community and I am 28-year old fella from Finland. I have recently
            graduated as a Bachelor of Engineering specialized in software
            development. I wanted to learn more about Web Development and
            decided to create my own website to showcase all kinds of stuff what
            I like to do and have accomplished in my life!
          </p>
          <p className="introduction-text">
            Plan is to update this website always when I feel like adding
            information in it. Also idea is to have this as a cool personal
            project to show in CV when applying for job opportunities in the
            tech industry or possibly something else. I currently have most
            experience related to programming with the Unity game engine and C#
            language. I consider myself still a newbie in development, so this
            website will definitely have lots of errors.
          </p>

          <p className="introduction-text">
            This is the homepage of my website with some introduction and
            information about the project. On top you can find different
            categories of my hobbies/interests/job related stuff and social
            media links. Also planning to add different languages.
