            Hi. My name is Jussi Meht채l채, also known as SKIPAH in gaming
            community and I am 28-year old fella from Finland. I have recently
            graduated as a Bachelor of Engineering with specialized in software
            development. I wanted to learn more about Web Development and
            decided to create my own website to showcase all kinds of stuff what
            I like to do and have accomplished in my life!
          </p>
          <p className="introduction-text">
            Plan is to update this website always when I feel like adding
            information or other stuff in it. Also idea is to have this as a
            cool personal project to show in CV when applying for job
            opportunities in the tech industry. I currently have most experience
            working with the Unity game engine and C# language. I consider
            myself still a newbie in development skills, so this website will
            definitely have lots of errors and scuffed stuff.
          </p>

          <p className="introduction-text">
            This is the homepage of my website with some introduction and
            information about the project. On top you can find different
            categories of my hobbies/interests/job related stuff and social
            media links. Also planning to add different languages.
