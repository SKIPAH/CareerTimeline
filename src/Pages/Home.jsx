            Yo! My name is Jussi Meht채l채, also known as SKIPAH in the gaming
            community, and I am a 28-year-old fella from Finland.

            Note!! This website is still under construction! Texts, colors,
            layouts etc etc are no final and I am still a beginner in Web
            development.

            I have recently graduated as a Bachelor of Engineering specialized
            in software development. I wanted to learn more about Web
            Development and decided to create my own website to showcase all
            kinds of stuff what I like to do and have accomplished in my life!
            Plan is to update this website always when I feel like adding
            information in it. Also idea is to have this as a cool personal
            project to show in CV when applying for job opportunities in the
            tech industry or possibly something else. I currently have most
            experience related to programming with the Unity game engine and C#
            language. I consider myself still a newbie with dev skills, so this
            website will definitely have lots of errors.

            This is the homepage of my website with some introduction and
            information about the project. On top you can find different
            categories of my hobbies/interests/job related stuff and social
            media links.
